## Weather providers 🌨️
- [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com)
- [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com)
- [met-norway](https://api.met.no/)
- [rainvewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/api.html)

Only now after working on Overmorrow for more than 6 months, have I realized that my 
app is defined as "non commercial" in open-meteo's documentation 😂. Which is great because i can use it completely for free 😎! 
So now i can add 14 days of forecast . Also its one of the most accurate weather providers.

you can also change your provider to met-norway or weatherapi.com.

All the radar images are from rainviewer's radar 💧.

## Why make Overmorrow? ❓
I am 15 and i have been programing since the age of 7. I started small (Scratch and NetsBlox) 
went to Python... and then to Flutter. This is my first ever project that can actually be downloaded by anyone. So I hope you like it 😉!

I have always wanted to make a weather app 🌩️. At first the concept was just to make an app that 
is free and ad free, but after diving into the whole thing i realized that i wouldn't be the first to do that. 
So instead here is my take on the weather app ui (but i did kep it free and ad free too 😎). I tried to go for a minimalist and organized interface.
