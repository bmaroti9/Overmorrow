## ❓ Why make Overmorrow?
I am 16 and i have been programing since the age of 7. I started small (Scratch and NetsBlox) 
went to Python... and then to Flutter. This is my first ever project that can actually be downloaded by anyone. So I hope you like it!

I have always wanted to make a weather app. At first the concept was just to make an app that 
is free and ad free, but after diving into the whole thing i realized that i wouldn't be the first to do that. 
So instead here is my take on the weather app ui (but i did kep it free and ad free too). I tried to go for a minimalist and organized interface... 

That was a year ago. Since then i have discovered material-You and have redesigned the app twice to try to follow the design guidelines, because I think it looks awesome.

## 🛠️ Built with
- 💙 **Flutter** — Cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- 🎨 **Material You** — Google's 3rd generation design system, introduced in android 12
