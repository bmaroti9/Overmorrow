## Why make Overmorrow?
I am 15 and i have been programing since the age of 7. I started small (Scratch and NetsBlox) 
went to Python... and then to Flutter. This is my first ever project that can actually be downloaded by anyone. So I hope you like it!

I have always wanted to make a weather app. At first the concept was just to make an app that 
is free and ad free, but after diving into the whole thing i realized that i wouldn't be the first to do that. 
So instead here is my take on the weather app ui (but i did kep it free and ad free too). I tried to go for a minimalist and organized interface. 

## Localization
